This guide contains the standard terminology and nomenclature for core theory and aural skills courses at CU–Boulder.

## Harmony

### Lead-sheet symbols

Lead-sheet symbols reflect the chord root and quality. The chord root is always capitalized in a lead-sheet symbol, regardless of chord quality.

Standard triads are as follows:

major triad: 

> C  

minor triad: 

> Dm or D<sup>m</sup>  

augmented triad: 

> G<sup>aug</sup> or G<sup>+</sup>  

diminished triad: 

> B<sup>dim</sup> or B°  

Seventh chords are as follows:

major-seventh chord: 

> C<sup>maj7</sup> or C<sup>M7</sup>  

dominant-seventh chord: 

> B&#9837;<sup>7</sup>  

minor-seventh chord: 

> A<sup>m7</sup>  

fully-diminished-seventh chord: 

> D°<sup>7</sup>  

half-diminished-seventh chord: 

> F#<sup>ø7</sup>

Inversions are shown with a slash. Use the lead-sheet symbol for the chord, followed by a slash, followed by the bass note. Following are a few examples.

first-inversion A-minor triad: 

> Am/C  

second-inversion C-augmented triad: 

> C<sup>+</sup>/G&#9839;  

third-inversion A-dominant-seventh chord: 

> A<sup>7</sup>/G

### Roman numerals

Roman numerals reflect both the scale degree of the chord root, and the quality of the chord. 

Upper-case Roman numerals denote a major triad, lower-case a minor triad, upper-case with a + sign augmented, lower-case with a ° sign diminished.

> I ii iii IV V vi vii°

Seventh chords that do not deviate from the key simply add a superscript 7 to the symbol for the triad onto which the seventh is added.

> I<sup>7</sup> ii<sup>7</sup> iii<sup>7</sup> IV<sup>7</sup> V<sup>7</sup> vi<sup>7</sup> vii°<sup>7</sup>

(These chords are major-seventh, minor-seventh, minor-seventh, major-seventh, dominant-seventh, minor-seventh, and diminished-seventh, respectively.)

Inversions are shown in Roman numerals by using abbreviated figured-bass (or [*thoroughbass*](http://openmusictheory.com/thoroughbassFigures.html)) symbols. These are placed after the Roman numeral as a superscript (like the 7 in seventh chords).

For root-position triads, no inversion symbol is attached to the Roman numeral. For other chords, the symbols are as follows:

- first-inversion triad: 6  
- second-inversion triad: 6/4  
- root-position seventh chord: 7  
- first-inversion seventh chord: 6/5  
- second-inversion seventh chord: 4/3  
- third-inversion seventh chord: 4/2

In music notation, or when writing by hand, arrange the numbers for each chord vertically (like below). When typing, however, this can be difficult to accomplish, so most musicians use a slash, like in the bullet list above.

### Functions

Harmonic functions are labeled below the Roman numeral analysis of a musical passage, using the following abbreviations:

- Tonic: T  
- Predominant: PD  
- Dominant: D

Note that some theorists call the predominant function "subdominant" or "dominant preparation." We will use subdominant (S) at times in second-year theory when exploring styles of music where these chords do not have as strong a tendency to progress to the dominant. In first-year theory, we will only use T, PD, and D.

### Functional bass

Functional bass notation will be used at times in the discussion of classical harmonic syntax. We will follow the conventions laid out in [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com).

### Applied chords

Applied-dominant chords (sometimes also called secondary-dominant chords) are notated with a slash:

> V7/V  
> vii°/ii

### Chromatically altered predominants

Abbreviated names, rather than Roman numerals, are used for these chords:

Neapolitan chord:

> N.

Italian augmented-sixth chord:

> It.

French augmented-sixth chord:

> Fr.

German augmented-sixth chord:

> Ger.

Swiss augmented-sixth chord:

> Sw.

### 6/4 chords

The following symbols are used, regardless of root.

Passing:

> P6/4

Neighbor:

> N6/4

Arpeggiated 6/4:

> Arp6/4 (Or simply use one Roman numeral followed by an extender line for all chords in the arpeggiation, then notate only the change in inversion symbols.)

Pedal 6/4:

> Ped6/4

Cadential 6/4 (resolving to V<sup>(7)</sup>):

> V — (with 6/4 – 5/3 or 8/6/4 – 7/5/3 above)

### Cadences

Perfect authentic cadence (PAC): root-position V<sup>(7)</sup> to root-position I, melody ends on *do*.

Imperfect authentic cadence (PAC): root-position V<sup>(7)</sup> to root-position I, melody ends on *mi/me* or *sol*.

Half cadence (HC): phrase-ending root-position V<sup>(7)</sup>.

Phrygian half cadence: phrase-ending root-position V<sup>(7)</sup> preceded by (minor) iv<sup>6</sup>.

Deceptive cadence (DC; non-normative for classical style, more common in chorales, Romantic, some pop/rock styles): phrase-ending V<sup>(7)</sup> – vi or VI.

Plagal cadence (PC; non-normative for classical style, more common in chorales, Romantic, some pop/rock styles): phrase-ending IV – I or i; phrase-ending ii6(5) – I.

### Sequences

Descending fifths.

Descending thirds, nickname "Pachelbel".

Ascending 5–6 (or alternative with root-position triads).

Ascending fifths.

## Form

We will generally follow the formal theories laid out in [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com). OMT follow's William Caplin's theories for binary form, ternary form, minuets, and rondo; James Hepokoski and William Darcy's theory for classical sonatas; and Jay Summach's theory for pop/rock form.
