This guide contains the standard terminology and nomenclature for core theory and aural skills courses at CU–Boulder.

## Harmony

### Lead-sheet symbols

Lead-sheet symbols reflect the chord root and quality. The chord root is always capitalized in a lead-sheet symbol, regardless of chord quality.

Standard triads are as follows:

- major triad: C  
- minor triad: Dm or D<sup>m</sup>  
- augmented triad: G<sup>aug</sup> or G<sup>+</sup>  
- diminished triad: B<sup>dim</sup> or B°  

Seventh chords are as follows:

- major-seventh chord: C<sup>maj7</sup> or C<sup>M7</sup>  
- dominant-seventh chord: B&#9837;<sup>7</sup>  
- minor-seventh chord: A<sup>m7</sup>  
- fully-diminished-seventh chord: D°<sup>7</sup>  
- half-diminished-seventh chord: F#<sup>ø7</sup>

Inversions are shown with a slash. Use the lead-sheet symbol for the chord, followed by a slash, followed by the bass note. Following are a few examples.

- first-inversion A-minor triad: Am/C  
- second-inversion C-augmented triad: C<sup>+</sup>/G#  
- third-inversion A-dominant-seventh chord: A<sup>7</sup>/G

### Roman numerals

Roman numerals reflect both the scale degree of the chord root, and the quality of the chord. 

Upper-case Roman numerals denote a major triad, lower-case a minor triad, upper-case with a + sign augmented, lower-case with a ° sign diminished.

> I ii iii IV V vi vii°

Seventh chords that do not deviate from the key simply add a superscript 7 to the symbol for the triad onto which the seventh is added.

> I<sup>7</sup> ii<sup>7</sup> iii<sup>7</sup> IV<sup>7</sup> V<sup>7</sup> vi<sup>7</sup> vii°<sup>7</sup>

(These chords are major-seventh, minor-seventh, minor-seventh, major-seventh, dominant-seventh, minor-seventh, and diminished-seventh, respectively.)
